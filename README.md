# Friend-Finder

A survey-based friend finding app that uses Express and its Path package to handle routing.

### How it works:

Users provide their name and photo and fill out a ten question survey. The survey results get compared with an existing "database" of friends (stored and displayed as JSON) and the most compatible friend is returned.
